# Nibor website

`Here be dragons â€¦ this readme needs some updating.`

## Setup

Make sure you have Node.js 8+ and yarn installed on your machine.

```
git clone github.com/ola-n/nibor-dressage.git
cd nibor-dressage
yarn install
```

Start dev server:

```
yarn start
```

Find the site on <http://localhost:8000>

There's also a graphQL debugger running at <http://localhost:8000/___graphql>

## Gatsby

For an overview of the project structure please refer to the
[Gatsby documentation - Building with Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/building-with-components/)

Before diving in head-first it might be a good idea to visit the excellent
[Getting started guide](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/) if you haven't already.
Furthermore, gatsby-cli might come in handy for quickly spinning up a clean
project to try out a new extension or so in isolation. Gatsby will try to assign
a new port for your projects if there's one running on :8000 already, so you
can have several gatsby sites running at once.
